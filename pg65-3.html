<!--Just to have it here too: Chrome Developer Tools Question Answer- Different formatting: indentation is different...so Dev tools do auto-formatting.  The Dev tool also collapses different sections of your code...I assume for easier reading?  

I noticed that the Dev tools added oddly a ==$0 after the initial body tag, which I find odd and don't understand the purpose of.  

Other than that, I'm not seeing anything else that the Dev tools has done to modify the code itself.
