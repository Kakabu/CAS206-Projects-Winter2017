  <h2>The Yurts at Pacific Trails</h2>
    
  <dl>
    <dt>What is a yurt?</dt><!--As it does oddly say to have a strong importance and a bold font weight -->
    <dd>Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground. Each yurt has canvas walls, a wooden floor, and a roof dome that can be opened.</dd>
    <dt>How are the yurts furnished?</dt>
    <dd>Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with a down quilt and gas-fired stove. The luxury camping experience also includes electricity and a sink with hot and cold running water.  Shower and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.</dd>
    <dt>What should I bring?</dt>
    <dd>Bring a sense of adventure and some time to relax!  Most guests also pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing weather with layers of clothing.</dd>
