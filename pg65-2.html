    <header><h2>Door County Wild Flowers</h2></header> <!-- the heading element was missing; I don't believe that the heading level is important here, so I chose heading level 2 just to be a bit different--> 
    <main>
        <!--Description List is more like a dictionary and appears to be rarely used anymore --> 
    <dl>
        <!--I believe the book is wrong with the indentation of the dt & dd tags as dd is not a nested child of dt --> 
        <dt>Trillium</dt> <!-- Defintion Term is what dt stands for -->
        <dd>This white flower blooms from April through June in wooded areas.</dd> <!--Definition Description is what dd stands for -->
        <dt>Lady Slipper</dt>
        <dd>This yellow orchid blooms in June in woodes areas.</dd>
    </dl>
        
        <p>This exercise was to fill in the missing tags, and the first thing that's missing is the heading element, which I chose to make an h2 vs. the perhaps more common h1. The next thing that was missing were the opening and closing tags for various parts of a description list, which creates a somewhat dictionary-esque word grouping with a title (the dt tag) and a description (the dd tag).  The dl tag could contain about anything, so I refrain from saying it's just word titles and definitions. I personally prefer pictures!  â˜» </p>
     
        <p>My tutor mentioned that they're related to hash tables/association lists...but I don't understand what those are yet!</p>
